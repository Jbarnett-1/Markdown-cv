## About
Previous experience in the pharmaceutical and chemistry lab area looking to join a creative software development and programming team. Through undergrad, I was required to use MATLAB to analyze and model chemical processes through equations I've learned. Over time, my interest grew and now I l troubleshoot, deploy, and debug Python scripts to make programs run smoothly. I'm currently expanding my expertise into websites with JavaScript and SQL and running containers on Kubernetes.
